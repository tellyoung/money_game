We provide tutorials for simple tasks.


### **1. Stock**

We demonstrate a full pipeline of a stock trading task in [NeurIPS 2018 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07522).

In the directory `./Stock_NeurIPS2018`, the three notebooks: ***Stock_NeurIPS2018_1_Data.ipynb***, ***Stock_NeurIPS2018_2_Train.ipynb***, ***Stock_NeurIPS2018_3_Backtest.ipynb*** show a workflow of applying ML/RL in algorithmic trading.

Once you are familiar with the above three files, feel free to run the notebook ***Stock_NeurIPS2018_SB3.ipynb*** and ***Stock_NeurIPS2018_ElegantRL.ipynb*** that follow a similar process to play with different RL libraries.


### **2. Portfolio Allocation**

The notebook ***FinRL_PortfolioAllocation_NeurIPS_2020.ipynb*** shows how to use FinRL do the classic task of portfolio allocation. 

***FinRL_PortfolioAllocation_NeurIPS_2020.py*** is a single python file that contains all the codes.


### **3. China A share**

***China_A_share_market_tushare.ipynb*** demonstrates how to trade on China A share market. We connect with the Tushare library to fetch data from China A share market.


### **4. Stock Fundamental**

***Stock_Fundamental.ipynb*** shows the process of training a deep reinforcement learning agent with companiesâ€™ fundamental indicators.

***China_A_share_market_tushare.py*** is a single python file that contains all the codes.


### **5. Forex Trading**

**ForexTrading_Demo.ipynb** gives the process of foreign exchange market trading.

***ForexTrading_Demo.py*** is a single python file that contains all the codes.
